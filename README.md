HubFlow (WebSharks Flavor)
=======

Adds the 'git hf' Git extension to provide high-level repository operations
for [DataSift's HubFlow branching model](http://datasift.github.com/gitflow/), which is based on [Vincent Driessenâ€™s original blog post](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/). See also: [WebSharks Flavor Changes](https://github.com/websharks/hubflow/blob/000000-dev/README.md#websharks-flavor-changes).

WebSharks Flavor Changes
-----------------------

- Added support for an additional synchronized repo that rides with the primary.
- Added a scan for an existing `000000-dev` branch; if it exists we use this over the default name: `develop` for the "next release" branch.

### Repo Synchronization

**To enable the synchronization functionality** (i.e. if you have both a lite/pro version you are maintaining together); use the `s` flag.

#### Example...

From your repo directory...
```
$ git hf init -asf
```

#### Usage...

From your repo directory...
```
$ git hf init -asf
```
... just fill in the blanks where it asks for your configuration. Most of it can just be left with the default values. To clarify, there are three flags here. `a` = ask for configuration values, `s` = enable synchronization functionality (optional), and `f` = force a new set of config values, overriding any that already exist. I recommend always using these flags together; i.e. `git hf init -asf`

**NOTE:** If you enable the `s` flag (synchronization) you will be asked for two config sets. That's normal. In synchronization mode all of your commands are duplicated across two repos.

Once you are configured, you can do this...

```
$ git hf feature start 123
```

... where `123` is a GitHub issue that is connected to a feature branch.
